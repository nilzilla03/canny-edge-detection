# canny-edge-detection
My first attempt at writing an image processing algorithm, assisted by many online sources (linked below). This wasn't an entirely serious project, given that not a lot of the code is mine, but it was definitely a learning experience. I plan to tackle more image processing algorithms on my own hereafter.
